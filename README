When Im at the second scean, the Githyanki's creche, Shadowheart reminds me to have a conversation of how she adopt by Shar(animation when she was a child). 
After the animition, she immediately have another conversation ******about she is in deep thinking*******
After that, when I initiate a conversation with her, the conversation perspective does not When I initiate a conversation, the conversation viewpoint is no longer second person, but third person (I can see my teammates instantly move to switch the location of the conversation between me and her), and Shadowheart no longer has the first lines that come with triggering a conversation (e.g., I'm thinking of you or butterflies in my heart). The dialog view doesn't switch to second person until after I click on a dialog option (such as What do you think of me and I have thoughts about our relationship).
I've run a simple exhaustive test so far, and the opportunity for the problem is having the conversation where ****** Shadowheart says he's contemplating ****** This doesn't happen if you switch scenes or wait long enough until the exclamation mark disappears.
I don't know if this is a bug causing the problem, or if it's just the "Shadowheart is brooding" plot manifestation, which seems really weird.
